# NewsArena - Your Daily Dose of Updates. 
NewsArena is a Single Page Application Website which can be used for the purpose of Reading latest day to day news accross various categories such as `business, politics, sports, health, entertainment` and many more! 

Just click on the category of your choice and news for the same will be populated on the feed. 

The website uses an API called `NEWSAPI` from where it fetches all the news as request by the user and then updates the webpage to show the corresponding result using the below mentioned Tech Stacks.

### The `Tech Stacks` used are :- 
<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>JavaSript</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>The API used for fetching the latest news is NEWSAPI</li>
</ul>
<hr>

`Note :-` Currently, The api used (i.e. NEWSAPI) does not allow hosting in it's free developer pack, So I am searching for some other free alternatives of NEWSAPI. Will update the repository as soon as I find some. Till then, If anyone wants to see the website, they can do it using the development server of VS Code or some other similar options.
